        <lcInstruction><p>A component content management system, or CCMS, is a software system that stores content and
                manages it at the topic or component level rather than at the document level. This
                makes a CCMS an ideal way to manage XML content. There are many CCMS options
                designed specifically for DITA content.</p>
            <fig><title>Overview of a typical CCMS</title><image href="../media/choosing_publishing_environment/ccms.png" width="500px" base="2017/03"
                id="image_atz_qlq_fz"/></fig><p>Different systems offer different sets of features; however, some features are common across
                almost all systems. Most CCMS options will connect with authoring tools (such as
                oXygen) and publishing tools (such as DITA OT plugins and rendering engines for PDF
                output). CCMS systems store DITA topics and maps and keep track of the content
                development workflow, including authoring, review, editing, and publishing.</p><p>Your best option for publishing may be with a CCMS if one or more of the following circumstances
                apply to you:</p><ul
                id="ul_r2t_pm4_cz">
                <li><b>Large content volume.</b> If you have thousands of pages of content
                    throughout many different documents, a CCMS will help make content storage and
                    publishing easier. Some systems let you choose different types of installations
                    at different price levels based on the number of topics you have. The CCMS will
                    help you keep track of all of your DITA maps and topics and the updates you’ve
                    made to them, which is especially helpful if you update frequently. A CCMS
                    allows you to set up automatic output builds—for example, nightly, weekly, or
                    monthly—to ensure that your published content is always up to date.</li>
                <li><b>Multiple outputs.</b> The more outputs you need to produce, the more helpful
                    a CCMS will be for publishing. Using a standalone DITA OT or publishing with
                    oXygen is reasonable if you only need to generate two different PDF outputs, for
                    example. If you need five PDF outputs, one HTML output, and two EPUB outputs, it
                    makes more sense to use the automated publishing capabilities of a CCMS.</li>
                <li><b>Many content creators.</b> A large content development team can benefit from
                    the robust workflow management provided by a CCMS. The CCMS keeps track of every
                    step of the content lifecycle, which helps content creators with version
                    control, reviews, and approvals. The more writers, contributors, and editors you
                    have, the more a CCMS can improve the efficiency of your content workflow.</li>
                <li><b>Reuse and localization.</b> Managing reuse manually without support from
                    tools is time-consuming and costly. If you’re reusing a large percentage of your
                    content, you probably have a business case for working in a CCMS. If you’re also
                    localizing content for other regions, your business case is even stronger.</li>
            </ul>
