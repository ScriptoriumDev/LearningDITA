            <p>Regardless of whether feed is purchased or mixed on the farm, it must be stored away from rodents and insects in a clean, dry place to prevent contamination and mold growth. A pair of
                rats can eat or contaminate over 100 lbs of feed in a year. </p>
            <p>Use the feed within 3 weeks of the manufacturerâ€™s date and sooner during hot, humid weather to prevent loss of vitamins and mold formation. </p>
