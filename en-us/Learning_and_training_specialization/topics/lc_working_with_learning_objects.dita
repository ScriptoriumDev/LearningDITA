            <p>The L&amp;T specialization was created with the reusable learning object, or RLO,
                approach to learning content in mind. This derived from work by learning content
                designers at Autodesk, Oracle, Cisco, and other companies. The idea is to create a
                collection of information objects that you can reuse and repurpose, depending on how
                you need to deliver your learning content.</p>
            <p>A learning object is a “discrete reusable collection of content used to present and
                support a single learning objective” (<xref

                content</xref>).</p>
            <p>The L&amp;T specialization implements learningObjects with the &lt;learningObject>
                element. The &lt;learningObject> element inherits its behavior from the
                &lt;topicref> element. It can contain references to the standard learning topics:</p>
