            <p>Best practices for writing good assessment questions:</p>
            <ul id="ul_nbx_3gv_scb">
                <li>Use the objectives in your lesson or course as a starting point. This will help
                    you write questions that test whether the student achieved the learning goals
                    you intended.</li>
                <li>Avoid creating assessments that depend on other assessments. DITA allows
                    questions to be displayed in a random order in your output. Therefore, writing a
                    question that builds on a previous question makes no sense.</li>
                <li>Just as the order of questions can be randomized, so can the order of the answer
                    choices. Therefore, it's best to use a multi-select interaction type rather than
                    a single-select with an "all of the above" answer choice, for example. If the
                    order of your answer choices is important, see if that question might work best
                    as a sequencing interaction type.</li>
                <li>When choosing an interaction type to frame your question, think about what you
                    want students to prove they know. True/false or single-select interactions
                    typically work best for testing their knowledge of facts, while matching or
                    sequencing interactions may work better for testing their understanding of more
                    complex concepts.</li>
