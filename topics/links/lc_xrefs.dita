      <p>Cross-reference let you link from one topic to another, or from text to a figure or table
                caption. You typically link to the figure or table title.</p>

            </p>
            <p>You can also use the &lt;xref> element to link to resources outside your DITA topics.
                For external references, you supply a @scope attribute with a value of external and
                a @format attribute, as shown
                    here:<pre>&lt;xref href="http://www.scriptorium.com" scope="external" format="html"/></pre><note>For
                    links to a PDF file, use @format = "pdf".</note></p>
            <p>Technically, it is possible to use &lt;xref> to link from one topic to another. This
                inline linking is a <tm tmtype="tm">Bad Idea</tm> because you have to create and
                maintain the link manually. You must specify what you are linking to. When you set
                up the cross-reference, you have the source and target topics in your map file. But
                if you reuse the source topic in another map that does not include the target topic,
                you will get a broken link in the output generated from that map, and you may not be
                notified about the problem.</p>
