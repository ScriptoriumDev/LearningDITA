            <p>Maps are used to compile, organize, and define the relationships among DITA topics.
                For example, a map might contain all of the concept and reference topics with
                information about a single product, along with all the task topics that give
                instructions for using that product, and a glossary of related terms. Although a
                single topic can be published on its own, many authors collect topics in maps to
                prepare them for publication.</p>
            <p>Using maps can add flexibility and facilitate reuse in your publishing workflow. If
                you have content that applies to multiple products, such as common safety
                information, you can write that topic once and reference it in multiple maps. You
                can also reference other maps within a map, which allows you to group related sets
                of topics together (such as compiling maps for individual products into a single map
                for a product family). Maps can also contain metadata, which can be used to help
                your company distribute your content or your customers find it more easily.</p>
            <p>At a minimum, a map must contain a root &lt;map> element. The &lt;map> element may
                contain the following elements:</p>
            <ul id="ul_oc4_2fd_3v">
                <li>
                    <p>The &lt;title> element, which allows you to name the map (such as "Product X
                        User Guide").</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Any number of &lt;topicref> elements, which allow you to link to topics that
                        should be included in the map. A &lt;topicref> element can contain other
                        &lt;topicref> elements.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Any number of &lt;mapref> elements, which allow you to link to other maps
                        that should be included in the main map.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Any number of &lt;reltable> elements, which allow you to create tables that
                        define relationships in your content.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The &lt;topicmeta> element, which defines map-level metadata. The
                        &lt;topicref> elements in your map (along with most other map-level
                        elements) can also contain a &lt;topicmeta> element.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <note>
                <p>This lesson covers basic use of the &lt;map> element and the map-level elements
                    it contains. For the full specifications for each element, see the <xref
                        href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/langref/concept.html"
