 <title>Technical standards</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>requirements<indexterm>technical</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>technical
        requirements</indexterm>Technical requirements primarily affect information delivery. There
      are, for example, U.S. government agencies that require information to be delivered in a
      specific format, such as
        <indexterm>XML<indexterm>specifications</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>Structured Product
          Labeling<index-see>SPL</index-see></indexterm><indexterm>SPL</indexterm><indexterm>XML<indexterm>SPL</indexterm></indexterm>
      SPL (XML standard for drug information) or <indexterm>military
        specification</indexterm><indexterm>40051 spec</indexterm>MIL-STD-40051 (a U.S. Department
      of Defense standard for technical manual preparation).</p>
  <p>Noncompliance is probably not an option, so you have just a few choices:<ul id="ul_rzy_1hl_dg">
    <li>Set up an authoring and publishing environment that creates the information products as
     specified.</li>
    <li>Create information products in a noncompliant format and then convert them to the required
     format.</li>
    <li>Hire a third-party vendor to create compliant documents from whatever you are creating.</li>
   </ul></p>

  <p><indexterm>government regulations</indexterm><indexterm>regulations,
      governmental</indexterm>Many government regulations now specify XML as a required format. In
      the past, regulations were more likely to require a specific delivery mechanism, such as paper
      or PDF. It was left to the organization creating the information to determine how to create
      the final format. But today, the requirement for XML goes much deeper. Instead of focusing on
      document appearance (double-spaced, uses a specific font, and is printed on US Letter paper),
      requiring XML means that you must correctly encode the meaning of the information. For
      example, a part number might need to be presented in boldface (<b>22-44-66</b>). In the XML
      specification, there are at least two ways to tag a part number that result in boldface
      output:<codeblock>&lt;b>22-44-66&lt;/b>
&lt;partno>22-44-66&lt;/partno></codeblock></p>
  <p>Only the semantically correct approach (&lt;partno>) would be acceptable.</p>
  <p>Another example is <indexterm>Extensible Business Reporting
        Language<index-see>XBRL</index-see></indexterm>Extensible Business Reporting Language
        <indexterm>XBRL</indexterm><indexterm>XML<indexterm>XBRL</indexterm></indexterm>(XBRL). The
      U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires reports in this XML standard, which is used
      for financial and other business information. Here are a few lines, chosen at random from a
      Google filing (and somewhat
      simplified):<codeblock>...
&lt;FurnitureAndFixturesGross>65000000
&lt;/FurnitureAndFixturesGross>
&lt;Goodwill>4903000000&lt;/Goodwill>
&lt;IncomeTaxesReceivable>23000000&lt;/IncomeTaxesReceivable>
&lt;IntangibleAssetsNetExcludingGoodwill>775000000
&lt;/IntangibleAssetsNetExcludingGoodwill>
...</codeblock></p>
  <p>Authoring in a standard office word processor with styles called Normal, Heading1, and so on
      will not result in information with this level of specific encoding. </p>

   <title>Building a compliant publishing system</title>

            compliant</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>compliance<indexterm>publishing system
            for</indexterm></indexterm>Setting up a publishing system that supports complex
        technical requirements is not for the faint of heart. This approach makes sense, however, in
        the following scenarios:<ul id="ul_lyk_gjl_dg">
          <li>A significant percentage of your business depends on compliant content. (For example,
            you are a defense contractor and are required to follow military standards.)</li>
          <li>You cannot afford any delays in content delivery. (For example, you are a
            pharmaceutical company, and you do not want a drug launch to be delayed because you are
            still converting over to the required format.)</li>
          <li>It is less expensive to set up a system in-house than it is to hire a vendor to do the
            work.</li>
          <li>Conversion is time-consuming and error-prone because the source files do not contain
            all of the information needed to generate the conforming files.</li>
        </ul></p>
   <p>For authors, working in a specialized system will require training and support to help them
        understand the new workflow. Full-time authors are generally expected to master professional
        tools, but if your content is created by part-time authors who have other responsibilities,
        the use of specialized tools can be a challenge.</p>

   <title>Converting to the required format</title>
   <p><indexterm>legacy content<indexterm>conversion</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>conversion<indexterm>to avoid changing content
            creation</indexterm></indexterm>Instead of upending your established content creation
        process, you can add conversion as a caboose to the established publishing process. The main
        advantage to this approach is that content creators do not have to change how they work.</p>
   <p>In some organizations, the content creators are subject matter experts (SMEs) with many other
        responsibilities. For example, a research scientist or a software engineer may be expected
        to contribute some content. For highly paid contributors with unique expertise, it can be
        sensible to accept content in a non-compliant format and  leave the publishing tasks to
        support staff. </p>
   <p><indexterm>Microsoft<indexterm>Word</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>Word,
          Microsoft</indexterm>Most often, the non-compliant format is Microsoft Word. That is,
        content is created in Word files and must later be converted to another format. Some
        automation is possible, but you can expect that conversion will take a significant amount of
        time (several days or several weeks) after the document content is completed.
            <indexterm>conversion<indexterm>in-house vs.
          outsourced</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>legacy content<indexterm>in-house vs.
            outsourced conversion</indexterm></indexterm>In-house conversion makes sense in the
        following situations:<ul id="ul_v1b_3zl_dg">
          <li>The requirement for compliance is a one-time event. For example, your organization has
            a single government contract that requires delivery in a specific format.</li>
          <li>Content creators are unwilling or unable to change their workflow.</li>
          <li>Content creatorsâ€™ time is so valuable that a change in workflow is out of the
            question.</li>
          <li>In-house staff has the expertise to either build a conversion process or to do a
            brute-force conversion.</li>
        </ul></p>
   <p>Other than the time required to convert the content, the biggest problem with a back-end
    conversion is that the source content may not include the needed information. Final documents
    may require <indexterm>metadata<indexterm>handling in
      conversion</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>conversion<indexterm>handling
      metadata</indexterm></indexterm>metadata (such as the author, last modified date, and document
    type) that is not available in the source format. The only way to ensure that the information is
    available is to build a process that takes those requirements into account.</p>

   <title>Offloading compliance onto a vendor</title>
   <p><indexterm>regulatory<indexterm>compliance, offloading onto
            vendor</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>compliance<indexterm>handled by
            vendor</indexterm></indexterm>Some organizations go a step further by outsourcing
        conversion to the required format to an outside vendor. This is reasonable for a one-time
        custom requirement, but if you are creating a lot of regulated content over time, you
        probably want to keep the process in-house. Most vendors use a combination of scripting and
        brute-force retagging to get the content into the required format. Outside conversion is
        often expensive and time-consuming.</p>
   <p>For government contracts, you may be limited to in-country vendors.</p>
