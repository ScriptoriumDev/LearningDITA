 <title>Extending the game experience into content</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>wiki</indexterm><indexterm>content<indexterm>extending game
    experience</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>game experience in
    content</indexterm><indexterm>experience, game</indexterm>The computer game industry has been at
   the forefront of collaborative authoring and user-generated content. Many games come with minimal
   documentation that explains only how to operate basic controls. After that, it is up to the
   player to explore the game world. In online role-playing games (such as World of Warcraft), there
   are hundreds of locations to explore, objects to find or buy, and monsters to fight. Even without
   explicit support from the game developer, the user community often gets together to create
   reference information for the game. </p>
  <p>For gamers, providing too much documentation can actually work against the gameplay experience.
   It might be wise, though, to provide support for the community to create their own documentation,
   perhaps by delivering a wiki with page stubs (starting points) along with user forums where
   players can discuss the game to their heartsâ€™ content.</p>
